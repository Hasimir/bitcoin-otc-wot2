================

A (hopefully) improved Web of Trust and ratings system for Bitcoin-OTC

Based on the document written by nanotube and first published
`here <http://privwiki.dreamhosters.com/wiki/Distributed_Web_of_Trust_Proposal_2>`__.

A basis for XML templates for certain types of exchanges upon which a
trust metric might serve some valuable purpose. Not all of which might
be strictly commercial in nature, as is the case with much of the
current Web of Trust and ratings employed in #bitcoin-otc on Freenode.


TODO
----

* Create one or more completed sample XML files demonstrating the methodology.
* Generate DTDs and/or Schema filesfrom these with oXygenXML Editor.
* Assess whether this would be better served as specialisation of DITA or as a separate thing (which may still be able to work with DITA within a data element or a foreign element).
