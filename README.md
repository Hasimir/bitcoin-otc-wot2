A (hopefully) improved Web of Trust and ratings system for Bitcoin-OTC


Based on the document written by nanotube and first published [here](http://privwiki.dreamhosters.com/wiki/Distributed_Web_of_Trust_Proposal_2).

A basis for XML templates for certain types of exchanges upon which a trust metric might serve some valuable purpose.  Not all of which might be strictly commercial in nature, as is the case with much of the current Web of Trust and ratings employed in #bitcoin-otc on Freenode.
