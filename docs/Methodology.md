Introduction
------------

The predecessors to this system, the OpenPGP Web of Trust and the Bitcoin OTC Web of Trust both have their roots in the need for a system of recommendation and reputation in order to facilitate a particular technical or otherwise entirely logical goal which did not immediately present the means to address the unpredictable element: the human factor.  In the case of OpenPGP the Web of Trust is essentially a means of introduction and verification that a particular cryptographic keypair belonged to a specific individual.  In the case of the Bitcoin OTC IRC channel the Web of Trust was an attempt to quantify and categorise the qualities of participants in order to facilitate trading in Bitcoins, other crypto-currencies, goods and services.

Within the strict confines of the original intent, the OpenPGP Web of Trust has been a guarded success, though it has not been without criticism.  In particular the lack of consistent key signing policies across all users, confusion regarding the levels attributed to types of signatures and how to address keys belonging to individuals maintaining a pseudonymous, yet consistent persona in their oonline dealings.

The Bitcoin OTC Web of Trust and ratings system has received somewhat more vocal criticism amongst those who have dealt with it, though it should really be considered the first step towards a more adaptable and robust system.  This is the intended successor to that system, hence the references to this one as version 2 and the existing rating system as version 1.  Version 1 has simply been an attempt at providing a means for rating interaction between parties involved with trade.
