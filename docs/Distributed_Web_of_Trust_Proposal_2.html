<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h1>
<p>The core components of any trust system are (a) data storage for 
nodes and links between them and (b) interpretation of the data into 
useful trust metrics. Once a publicly accessible distributed storage 
framework is developed and populated, there can be any number of 
competing trust metrics building upon it. Thus, the development of an 
open framework for distributed store of trust links will serve to create
 an ecosystem of trust services around it.
</p><p>Ideally, the node identifiers used in the trust network would be 
easily exportable and usable in any arbitrary alternative location, so 
that a person can prove he owns a particular identity in many different 
contexts. Further, the trust links should be cryptographically signed, 
so that the validity thereof can be independently verified by any third 
party. 
</p><p>The present proposal suggests a robust, flexible, and distributed
 framework for a web of trust, using PGP keys as node identifiers and 
for cryptographic signatures.
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_structure">Basic structure</span></h1>
<p>The node identifiers used in this web of trust will be standard-issue
 PGP keys. Each node will create and maintain a structured signed 
ascii-armored message, which contains link data assigning ratings to 
other keys, identified by the standard key fingerprint. 
</p><p>The complete data packet is to be a structured XML file, of the following format:
</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;

&lt;weboftrustdatapacket version="1.0"&gt;

&lt;info&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;name of this weboftrustpacket chain&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;timestamp&gt;unixtimestamp&lt;/timestamp&gt;
  &lt;owner&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;human readable name&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;signingkey&gt;
      &lt;type&gt;key type (e.g. PGP)&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;fingerprint&gt;hashtype:print&lt;/fingerprint&gt;
    &lt;/signingkey&gt;
    &lt;signingkey&gt; .... &lt;/signingkey&gt;
  &lt;/owner&gt;
&lt;/info&gt;

&lt;data&gt;
  &lt;contractinstance timestamp="timestamp"&gt;
    &lt;contractref url="url where contract template body may be retrieved" hash="hashtype:hash"/&gt;
    &lt;contractarguments&gt;
        &lt;!-- these are just examples, and will vary depending on contract type --&gt;
        &lt;targetkeyfingerprint&gt;hashtype:print&lt;/targetkeyfingerprint&gt;
        &lt;rating&gt;rating&lt;/rating&gt;
        &lt;propagationrating&gt;propagationrating&lt;/propagationrating&gt;
        &lt;comment&gt;blabla&lt;/comment&gt;
    &lt;/contractarguments&gt;
  &lt;/contractinstance&gt;
  &lt;contractinstance&gt;.....&lt;/contractinstance&gt;
&lt;/data&gt;

&lt;key id="hashtype:fingerprint"&gt;
user's ascii-armored key goes here
&lt;/key&gt;

&lt;/weboftrustdatapacket&gt;
</pre>
<p>The <b>info</b> element contains this node's identifying info, 
requiring timestamp, name of chain, owner info. owner info must contain a
 name, info on one or more signing keys (for group or organization 
accounts). Any other optional attributes may be included in the <b>info</b>
 section. All fingerprints/hashes are to be formatted with the hash 
algorithm first (with names as defined by GPG, such as SHA1, SHA256, 
etc.), followed by a colon, then the hash result, upper or lower case, 
with or without spaces. (Current default hash type for GPG fingerprints 
is SHA1).
</p><p>The <b>data</b> element contains a number of <b>contractinstance</b>
 elements, each of which is an instance of a signed contract,  
establishes a link between the current node and some other target node 
(or possibly multiple nodes, depending on contract type). 
</p><p>The <b>contractinstance</b> element is an instance of a signed 
contract, referencing a particular url and hash, and providing the 
arguments that it requires. It has a unixtime timestamp, a reference to a
 contract via a <b>contractref</b> element, and a list of <b>contractarguments</b>.
 The contract arguments differ depending on contract. The 'initial' 
default contract is specified below. It takes a target key fingerprint 
and type, a trust rating, a trust propagation rating, and an optional 
free-form comment. Details on the first version of the rating contract 
are discussed in the next section.
</p><p>Subsequent to the data element, ancillary information is included which is necessary to verify the validity of the packet. The <b>key</b>
 element(s) include the public key(s) of the node. At the option of 
client implementation, the public keys of other nodes referenced in the 
links may be included in additional <b>key</b> elements referenced by fingerprint in the 'id' attribute.
</p><p><br>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Rating_contract">Rating contract</span></h2>
<p><i>Future contracts may be alternative rating schemes, loan tracking contracts to help establish credit ratings, credit insurance, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://assholeinsurance.com/">asshole insurance</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.l3s.de/%7Eolmedilla/events/MTW06_papers/presentation04/presentation04.html">information/spam filters</a>, and anything else that may come up. The implementation leaves room for flexibility and expansion.</i>
</p><p><i>One type of contract to consider is mutually-pre-agreed 
ratings, wherein the parties first sign messages agreeing to be rated by
 each other, and those messages are then passed as arguments to the 
rating contract. This type of contract would avoid spam ratings from 
rogue identities. On the negative side, however, a community of users 
that finds a particular user to be a scammer cannot collectively assign 
negative trust to him to indicate said information. But for certain 
purposes, such as credit ratings maybe, this may be a more desirable 
contract.</i>
</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;

&lt;OTCTrustContract version="1.0"&gt;

&lt;entity name="bitcoin-otc"
email="admin@bitcoin-otc.com"/&gt;

&lt;definition name="arguments"&gt;

This contract takes the following named arguments:

targetkeyfingerprint
rating
propagationrating
comment

&lt;/definition&gt;

&lt;definition name="targetkeyfingerprint" type="argument"&gt;
This is the fingerprint hash type, in upper or lower case, with the
hash algorithm short name as defined by GPG, such as SHA1, SHA256,
etc, followed by a colon, then by the fingerprint hash of the target
key, with or without spaces, upper or lower case.

At the time of this writing the usual GPG key fingerprint is a SHA1
hash of the key.
&lt;/definition&gt;

&lt;definition name="rating" type="argument"&gt;
The rating field is to be your rating of your trust in the target
node. This rating should be a real number between -100 and 100
inclusive, with a maximum of 5 decimal places of precision.

The contract operationalizes the trust values in a currency-neutral
way, by making the values of 0-100 mean "percent of current world GDP
per capita that I would trust this person with". For reference, the
2010 GDP per capita as expressed in 2010 dollars was about 9200
USD. This measure is not, however, attached to USD in any way, since
the world GDP per capita can be measured in anything. It is also
relatively conveniently scaled, and is likely to remain a 'reasonable
value' for the foreseeable future. The reference value is usually
reported in a number of publicly accessible sources.
    
Negative values are to be interpreted as your estimation of the
percent chance that the target person would abscond with your assets
if given the chance. This is more difficult to measure with precision,
and serves only as a rough guideline.
&lt;/definition&gt;

&lt;definition name="propagationrating" type="argument"&gt;
The propagation rating is your rating of "how much do you trust the
target node to be reasonable in assigning trust to others". It should
be between 0 and 100 inclusive, with 0 meaning "I think this person
hands out trust ratings extremely lightly and I don't trust the
results", 100 meaning "I know this person is extremely careful in
assigning his trust ratings", and everything else approximately
linearly interpolated in between.

The concept of separating your basic trust rating from the trust
propagation rating comes from freenet's FMS web of trust. The idea is
that while you may trust someone to be an upstanding member of the
community when dealing with you, you may not necessarily trust that
person to be diligent and conservative in assigning trust to
others. Since the core of a "web of trust" style trust metric is
the analysis of chains of trust from you to a particular target key, this
trust in assigning trust is a very important concept and deserves
separate recognition.
&lt;/definition&gt;

&lt;definition name="comment" type="argument"&gt;
The comment field is to be an arbitrary text string commenting on the
circumstances of the rating, or holding any other ancillary
information.
&lt;/definition&gt;

&lt;definition name="validation" type="code" language="lua"&gt;
# here comes lua code to validate arguments passed to the contract
# and perform any other contract validity checking
# for this particular contract, all we need to do is to check
# that arguments are of the appropriate types and within bounds.
# other contracts may introduce further dependencies for validity.
f = function(targetkeyfingerprint,rating,propagationrating,comment)
  if &lt;all arguments validate&gt; then
    return true
  end
  return false
end
&lt;/definition&gt;

&lt;definition name="description"&gt;

The signatory to this contract asserts that the signatory trusts the
legitimate holder, hereinafter known as the TARGET, of the PGP key
identified with &lt;targetkeyfingerprint/&gt; (which is a hash of type
&lt;targetkeyfingerprinttype/&gt; of said PGP public key), to the extent of
&lt;rating/&gt;, on a scale described in the named definition above, at the
time of creation of the rating.

The signatory further asserts that the signatory trusts the TARGET to be
prudent in assigning trust &lt;rating/&gt; to others to the extent measured
by &lt;propagationrating/&gt;, on a scale described in the named definition
above.
&lt;/definition&gt;

&lt;condition name="liability"&gt;
This contract does not imply any liability or insurance on the part of
the signatory against any misbehavior of the TARGET and is provided
for informational purposes only.
&lt;/condition&gt;

&lt;key id='hastype:fingerprint of contract signing key'&gt;
key goes here 
&lt;/key&gt; 

&lt;/OTCTrustContract&gt;
</pre>
<p>If multiple ratings of the same timestamp exist in the file, the 
latest one is to be used as the rating in-force. Though there is no 
guarantee or requirement to keep old ratings in place, it is recommended
 to retain them since rating history for a node can provide for a more 
in-depth analysis of the trustworthiness of a node. (Note: should this 
go into the contract itself?)
</p><p>(The treatment of multiple links between two nodes on a 
particular contract may differ depending on contract type, trust metric,
 and client implementation.)
</p><p>The target key fingerprint is the fingerprint of the key of the 
node you are rating, preceded by a colon, and hash algorithm name short 
name as defined by GPG.
</p><p>The rating and propagation ratings are described in the contract at length and form the core of this contract.
</p><p>Comment is a free-form comment on this rating, and may contain additional structured data for machine parsing.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Structured_data_in_the_comment">Structured data in the comment</span></h3>
<p>There is some value to having standards for putting more structured 
data into the rating comments, specifically with regard to trade amount,
 units, payment method, and who sent first. Suggested format is to allow
 the insertion of a json-style dict structure, with fields of "amount", 
"unit", "payment_method", and "i_sent_first". So we might see the 
following in a rating comment:
</p>
<pre>{'amount':30,'unit':'bitcoin','payment_method':'amazon giftcard','i_sent_first':1}
</pre>
<p>The structure is flexible enough that additional fields may be defined by wot users as the need arises.
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Data_storage_and_retrieval">Data storage and retrieval</span></h1>
<p>Each user can store his signed ratings packet anywhere he wishes, as 
long as it is publicly accessible and persistent - from a personal 
website, to a persistent pastebin, to a github gist, to a git 
repository. To allow people to discover the location of the data storage
 url, users are to put this url in a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.2.3.16">notation data</a>
 field on their PGP key. Thereby, anyone who's crawling the web for 
trust ratings, can retrieve the keys associated with each rating, find 
the next data packet from the notation data field, and iteratively get 
the entire web of data. A change in the storage location is not a 
problem, since the notation data field in a PGP key can be updated and 
the key reuploaded to the keyservers at need. Multiple urls can be 
stored in multiple notation data packets.
</p><p>TODO: define notation data key structure. Something like woturl@bitcoin-otc.com&nbsp;?
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Assuring_redundancy">Assuring redundancy</span></h2>
<p>Since each data packet would generally only be stored in one place in
 the above framework, there is naturally a worry that nodes would drop 
off the net due to site issues. This is mitigated via several 
mechanisms. First, each client will tend to keep an cached copy of a 
subset of the WOT on local disk (whatever is needed for previous trust 
path determinations). Further, it is suggested to set up several 
independent WOT crawlers to collect and aggregate data on a regular 
basis (which would basically be modified clients, with a publicly 
accessible data api). In addition, general-purpose web archivers (such 
as archive.org), and web cachers (such as google cache) would also tend 
to create backup copies. In other words, relying on existing distributed
 http/ftp infrastructure for distributed data storage seems to be able 
to provide enough resiliency, and does not present a single point of 
failure or attack.
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Trust_Metric">Trust Metric</span></h1>
<p>Once the data is out there and available to the public, and every 
rating is cryptographically signed, anyone can come in and start his own
 trust metric based on the data, if he thinks he can do a good job of 
it. We anticipate that in the future there will be many competing trust 
metrics of various kinds. The initial implementation, however, will use a
 "web of trust" style metric, which would look for multi-node trust 
links between a starting node and a target node. The design is resistant
 to a number of possible attacks on the trust network, such as 
whitewashing and slander via bogus identities. Since by construction 
there is no limitation to the creation of identities, other than the 
computational cost of creating a new key, such attacks are important to 
keep in mind by any trust metric using the data.
</p><p>To this end, it is also proposed to have a minimum key length and
 type requirement for this first version (4096 bit RSA suggested), to 
make it somewhat computationally costly (at least as far as entropy 
gathering) to create bogus identities in the system.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="A_trust_metric:_straight-up_web_of_trust">A trust metric: straight-up web of trust</span></h2>
<p>The first trust metric that is planned to be implemented is an 
intuitive and straight-forward trust propagation from source to target 
node along all possible paths of length &lt; N (where N will probably be
 something like 6, and could be user-configurable per-request. Should 
probably be capped at some upper limit to control the calculation 
complexity). It will essentially be a type of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_network">flow network</a>.
</p><p>We hereby define the following functions for ease of exposition:
</p>
<pre>rating(x,y) is the trust rating given by node x to node y
trust(x,y) is the trust propagation rating given by node x to node y
</pre>
<p>If there is a link between node x and node y, both rating(x,y) and 
trust(x,y) should be defined, and should be within the ranges specified 
above, to be considered valid.
</p><p>Along a particular path, trust propagates from source to target 
node. Say we have a trust path from node A via node B to node C. The 
question is, what trust value should node A derive for node C as a 
result of this trust path? The algorithm to calculate this is as 
follows:
</p>
<pre>if (rating(A,B) &gt; 0): sign(rating(B,C)) * min(abs(rating(B,C)), trust(B,C))
if (rating(A,B) &lt; 0): 0 (we don't trust anyone we rate negatively to give valid ratings to anyone)
</pre>
<p>As any path of more than two hops consists of a chain of multiple 
two-hops, the same algorithm can be applied to longer paths. Any paths 
that contain a negative rating at some point along them, not including 
the very last one, will have zero contribution, since any negatively 
rated node cannot propagate trust, as per above.
</p><p>One more issue to take into account, as we aggregate trust from 
multiple paths, is to not exceed the trust capacity of any node. For 
example, if we have the following trust network,
</p>
<pre>A -&gt; (50,50) -&gt; B -&gt; (50,50) -&gt; C -&gt; (50,50) -&gt; E
                 \-&gt; (50,50) -&gt; D -&gt; (50,50) -/
</pre>
<p>then there are two paths from node A to node E, ABCE, and ABDE. As we
 calculate the propagated trust for each path, we clearly come up with a
 trust of 50 for both. However, since both paths go through node B, and 
node A only trusts B at 50, the total trust that A should have for E 
should be no larger than 50. In essence, after the first path has been 
calculated, the trust capacity of node B with respect to A has been 
exhausted, and no further paths containing B need to be considered. 
Thus, the calculation becomes slightly more complex, as we need to keep 
track of each node's trust capacity as we aggregate the trust in a 
subnetwork.
</p><p>Side note: One possibly-interesting metric coming from this 
method of trust calculation, is to find the percentage of a node's total
 trust capacity that is active in propagating trust to some particular 
target node. 
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Attack_resistance">Attack resistance</span></h3>
<ul><li> Self-promotion (artificially inflating rating via shill identities): resistant
</li><li> Slander (artificially decreasing targeted nodes' rating via false negative feedback and shill identities): resistant
</li><li> Whitewashing (identity-hopping, relying on past good history 
to carry out short-term attacks): not resistant due to ease of identity 
creation and no historical discounting
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Problems">Problems</span></h3>
<p>A newcomer to the web of trust, if relying solely on the scheme 
described above, has absolutely no information on whom to trust, since 
he's not connected to anyone to start with, unless he has some external 
information on who some reliable parties/seed nodes are. 
</p><p>This would probably be mitigated eventually by the evolution of 
various well-known rating agencies or other well-known trustworthy 
parties that could be used as anchors by people willing to trust them. 
Alternative trust metrics that provide aggregate views may be helpful 
here as well, though any such metrics should be cognizant of the various
 attack techniques.

<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Interface">Interface</span></h1>
<p>A technically-savvy user does not need any special interface to 
create and maintain a structured text file and sign it with gpg. For the
 rest of the world, we plan on creating a friendly web of trust-specific
 wrapper for the commandline gpg client, which will allow the user to 
easily maintain and sign the ratings file. 
</p><p>Additionally, the same interface should support querying the 
keyservers for keys, retrieving and verifying the associated ratings 
files from the URLs specified in notation data, and presenting graphical
 web of trust and other summary information, to give the user an idea of
 how trusted a particular target node is.
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Non-technical_user_services">Non-technical user services</span></h1>
<p>For those who don't want to deal at all with creating, securing, and 
safeguarding their gpg keys, it is anticipated that web-based services 
will develop that create a keypair for a user upon signup and hold it in
 escrow, allowing the user to manage his web of trust via his account on
 the site. The benefit of using PGP keys underneath is that a user <i>could</i> request his key from the service and take his business elsewhere, or run the standalone client. A technically-savvy user also <i>could</i>
 if he wanted to import his private key to a trusted service provider, 
or just open an account and tie it with his public key by providing a 
signed message. 
</p><p>In other words, using open source public key cryptography at the 
core of the system, by its nature eliminates vendor lock-in and allows 
the web of trust identity to travel with the user no matter where he 
goes. By providing structured signed messages, a user could tie his 
amazon or ebay accounts, for example, to his web of trust node. Other 
services that currently use proprietary mini-webs-of-trust but would 
like to join forces, could simply create PGP keypairs for their users 
and join the global web of trust. Good candidates for that could be the 
various p2p loan sites, for example, smaller auction sites and other 
smaller communities. 
</p><p>The design of such services would of course need to be built with
 security in mind from the ground up. Since the service by design holds 
private keys of a great number of users, it becomes an attractive 
hacking target. It may be suggested that the private keys be stored on a
 separate hardened server that only accepts authenticated signature 
requests and returns signed data packets, while the private keys never 
leave the confines of the server, e.g.. It should also require some kind
 of true two-factor authentication, such as via Yubikey or SMS.
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="FAQ">FAQ</span></h1>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_not_use_key_signatures.3F">Why not use key signatures?</span></h2>
<p>A couple of reasons. First, currently the key signatures are used as 
an indicator that you have verified the other key's identity, building 
the "pgp web of trust" which is about verifying real life id, rather 
than being any kind of indicator of trustworthiness. Trying to glom on a
 trading-trust web into an existing web that's about something 
completely different would be problematic at best.
</p><p>Further, key signatures do not provide the flexibility afforded by the design of the contracts system.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Trust_contract:_Why_is_the_scale_-100_to_100.3F">Trust contract: Why is the scale -100 to 100?</span></h2>
<p>The idea is to keep things intuitive. Having a positive trust scale 
from 0 to 100 is something everyone can understand without arduously 
long explanations. It also lends itself nicely to the proposed scale of 
world GDP per capita, as above. If we go for something like "the range 
of a signed int" things get a little hairy in that department. Current 
proposal also suggests to keep it down to no more than 5 decimal places 
of precision.
